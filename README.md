# MazeGenesis
Bunch of maze algorithms, see how they create mazes. List of algorithms implemented:

- Depth-First Search (DFS) with Backtracking
- Binary Tree
- Randomized Kruskal's
- Randomized Prim's
- Recursive Division
- Eller's Algorithm
- Growing Tree
- Wilson's Algorithm
- Hunt & Kill

## How to Use
1. Select maze dimensions (height and width)
2. Choose initial grid state (walls or empty)
3. Select a generation algorithm
4. Click "Start" to begin generation
5. Use "Solve Maze" to find a path with A*
6. Click "Reset" to clear the canvas
